# fastlane-with-github-actions-implementation

You Just need to follow all the below stpes to automate your releases with fastlane and github actions in no time 

This component is actually a semi circle slider but it is designed in this way that you can use it as color picker too.

## 1. Fastlane Installation:

```tsx
xcode-select --install
brew install ruby
sudo gem install fastlane -NV
```

## 2. Fastlane Setup:

```tsx
cd you_project_directory
fastlane init
```
### Now select option 2:
```tsx
[07:30:10]: What would you like to use fastlane for?
1. üì∏  Automate screenshots
2. üë©‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è  Automate beta distribution to TestFlight
3. üöÄ  Automate App Store distribution
4. üõ†  Manual setup - manually setup your project to automate your tasks
```

### Now enter your apple developer credetials:
```tsx
[13:03:04]: Please enter your Apple ID developer credentials
[13:03:04]: Apple ID Username:
<YOUR_EMAIL>
[13:04:36]: Logging in...
```

### If you haven't created App ID yet, fastlane can do it for you. Press `y` if you want to create App ID, else press `n`. 
```tsx
Logging in with your Apple ID was successful
[00:56:27]: Checking if the app ‚Äòyour_bundle_id‚Äô exists in your Apple Developer Portal‚Ä¶
[00:56:27]: It looks like the app ‚Äòyour_bundle_id‚Äô isn‚Äôt available on the Apple Developer Portal
[00:56:27]: for the team ID ‚Äòyour_team_id‚Äô on Apple ID ‚Äòyour_apple_id‚Äô
[00:56:27]: Do you want fastlane to create the App ID for you on the Apple Developer Portal? (y/n)
```
### If you haven't created an App yet, then fastlane can do it for you. Press `y` if you want to create an App, else press `n`
```tsx
App Name: your_project_name
[01:01:00]: Creating new app ‚Äòyour_project_name‚Äô on the Apple Dev Center
[01:01:01]: Created app your_app_id
[01:01:02]: Finished creating new app ‚Äòyour_project_name‚Äô on the Dev Center
[01:01:02]: ‚úÖ Successfully created app
[01:01:02]: Checking if the app ‚Äòyour_bundle_id‚Äô exists on App Store Connect‚Ä¶
[01:01:03]: Looks like the app ‚Äòyour_bundle_id‚Äô isn‚Äôt available on App Store Connect
[01:01:03]: for the team ID ‚Äòyour_team_id‚Äô on Apple ID ‚Äòyour_apple_id‚Äô
[01:01:03]: Would you like fastlane to create the App on App Store Connect for you? (y/n)
```
### After installing dependecies, two files `Fastfile` and `Appfile` will be created in `your_project/Fastlane`.

## 3. Fastlane Match Configuration:

Fastlane match initialisation:

```tsx
cd Fastlane
fastlane match init
```
Then select option 1 `git`

```tsx
[01:00:00]: fastlane match supports multiple storage modes, please select the one you want to use:
1. git
2. google_cloud
3. s3
?
```
Now give the URL of newly created repo for certificate and provisioning profile. If you havn't created repo for certificate and provisioning profile then please do it.

```tsx
[01:00:00]: Please create a new, private git repository to store the certificates and profiles there
[01:00:00]: URL of the Git Repo: <YOUR_CERTIFICATES_REPO_URL>
```
Now you will get the `Matchfile` with the following code:

```tsx
git_url("https://github.com/gitusername/certificates")
storage_mode("git")
type("appstore")
```
## 4. Configure Fastfile and Appfile:

Now in `your_project/Fastlane/Fastfile` replace your Fastfile and Appfile with my `Fastfile` and `Appfile` provided inside `Fastlane` folder in this repo.

Now change the following things according to your project. Like:
```tsx
increment_build_number(xcodeproj: "YourApp.xcodeproj")
```

```tsx
gym(
      configuration: "Release",
      workspace: "YourApp.xcworkspace",
      scheme: "YourApp",
      export_method: "app-store",
      output_directory: './build',
      output_name: "your_app_name.ipa",
      export_options: {
        provisioningProfiles: {
            DEVELOPER_APP_ID => PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER
        }
      }
    )
```
```tsx
pilot(
      apple_id: "#{DEVELOPER_APP_ID}",
      app_identifier: "#{DEVELOPER_APP_IDENTIFIER}",
      skip_waiting_for_build_processing: true,
      skip_submission: true,
      distribute_external: false,
      notify_external_testers: false,
      ipa: "./build/your_app_name.ipa"
    )
```
```tsx
git_commit(
      path: [
          "./YourApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj",
          "./YourApp/Info.plist",
        ],
       message: "Increment Build number"
     )
    version = get_version_number(
      xcodeproj: "YourApp.xcodeproj",
      target: "YourAppTarget"
     )
    build_num = get_build_number(
      xcodeproj: "YourApp.xcodeproj",
    )
```
And now change the `Appfile` according to project too

```tsx
app_identifier("xxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxx") # The bundle identifier of your app
apple_id("xxxxx@xxxx.xxx") # Your Apple email address

team_id("xxxxxxxxxxxx") # Developer Portal Team ID

# For more information about the Appfile, see:
# https://docs.fastlane.tools/advanced/#appfile

```

## 5. Environment File Setup:

I have provided the `.env` file in this repo. You just to put this file inside `your_project/Fastlane`

### Initialisation of all the environment variables:
#### Lets create app store connect Api Key first:
1. Login to App Store Connect
2. Click on `Users and Access`

6. Now copy `issuer ID`, `key ID` and download `Api key`. And make sure to save the `Api Key` because you can only download it once.

Now placed <b>`issuer ID`</b> and <b>`key ID`</b> against <b>`APPLE_ISSUER_ID` and `APPLE_KEY_ID`</b> in .env file respectively. And now drag and drop your downloaded Api key in Visual Studio Code or any editor, you will get Apple key content. Placed this content against 'APPLE_KEY_CONTENT' in .env file
